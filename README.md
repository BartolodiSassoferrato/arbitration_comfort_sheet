## Summary

AI-driven app simulating international arbitration dynamics. Users input arbitrator data; the system analyzes behavior, leadership likelihood, social media, and past conduct to predict decisions based on self-interest rather than fairness.

## Background

International litigation and arbitration have become inextricably entangled and complex, involving numerous stakeholders,
including arbitrators, institutional managers, global investors, trade partners, and internationally ranked law firms. 
Also, the total amount of damages and restitution sought in international arbitration has skyrocketed in recent years,
creating an assessment problem not only for third-party funders but also for all other stakeholders, who are equally relevant.
There are many other apps to emulate arbitratorsÂ´ decision-making but only referred to the law. 
This project is grounded in Scandinavian legal realism and the US philosophy of economic analysis, which posits that 
adjudicators decide cases not on their merits but out of self-interest, adhering to Nash game theory rather than the law.

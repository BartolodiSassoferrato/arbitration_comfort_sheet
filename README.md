# arbitration_comfort_sheet

## Summary

AI-driven app simulating international arbitration dynamics. Users input arbitrator data; the system analyzes behavior, leadership likelihood, social media, and past conduct to predict decisions based on self-interest rather than fairness.

## Background

International litigation and arbitration have become inextricably entangled and complex, involving numerous stakeholders,
including arbitrators, institutional managers, global investors, trade partners, and internationally ranked law firms. 
Also, the total amount of damages and restitution sought in international arbitration has skyrocketed in recent years,
creating an assessment problem not only for third-party funders but also for all other stakeholders, who are equally relevant.
There are many other apps to emulate arbitratorsÂ´ decision-making but only referred to the law. 
This project is grounded in Scandinavian legal realism and the US philosophy of economic analysis, which posits that 
adjudicators decide cases not on their merits but out of self-interest, adhering to Nash game theory rather than the law.

## Whose problems does this project address? 

Third-party funders, the global pool of investors and trade partners resorting to arbitration for conflict resolution, 
globally-ranked law firms, and arbitrators per se.

## Which problems does your idea solve?

This project addresses the lack of a recurring, constant feedback instrument to assess personal behavior following their own 
interest in complex scenarios like international arbitration.

## How common or frequent is this problem?

This is an ongoing and incrementally serious problem worldwide.

## What is your personal motivation?

My hard experience as a litigator gave me the idea of this unexplored path

## Why is this topic important or interesting?

The billions and billions in liquid assets involved in global litigation. 

## How is it used?

Solutions would primarily be directed to the stakeholders involved, serving as a tool rather than the final resource.


Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
